What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git initializes an empty repository in the directory where you ran the init command.
You need to run git init to tell Git to create tracking files for that directory.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is an intermediary between the working directory and the repository.
It gives you the flexibility to group files in your working directory together so that you can
control what goes in to each commit to the repository.
